This gives us the opportunity to help communities all over the country. \n\nWe are not in this for profits, we sincerely care about our fellow human beings, and believe it's our responsibility to lead by example. Price-gouging and profiteering are rampant, and countless companies are taking advantage of those effected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Enough is enough!
